#### Environment
Code editor: Jupyter Notebook 6.1.12
Language: Python 3.7.3
Software: Tableau Public

## Overview
The purpose of the project is to analyze NYC bikesharing information in order to assess if a similar project is convenient for the city of Des Moines, Iowa.

The results of the analysis and visualizations are detailed below.    

![Number of rides](https://github.com/MarcoFernandez14/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Number%20of%20Rides.png)  
Male riders represent 65% of total rides.  

![Average trip duration](https://github.com/MarcoFernandez14/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Average%20Trip%20Duration.png)  
There is a positive correlation between birth year and the average trip duration. The younger the rider, the longer the ride.  

![Top 5 starting locations](https://github.com/MarcoFernandez14/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top%205%20Starting%20Locations.png)  
The Top 5 stating locations show where the bikes are most requested.  Most of the rides start in Manhattan.  

![Checkout times for users](https://github.com/MarcoFernandez14/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Check%20out%20times%20for%20Users.png)  
Most of the rides last less than 20 minutes.   
The trip duration mode equals to five minutes.  

![Checkout times by gender](https://github.com/MarcoFernandez14/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Check%20out%20times%20by%20Gender.png)  
No matter the gender, the checkout times mode is around 5 minutes.  

![Trips by weekday per hour](https://github.com/MarcoFernandez14/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)  
During weekdays, the bikes are requested the most during rush hours (around 8am and 5pm). This could potentially indicate that bikes are used  mainly by locals to go to work.  

![Trips by gender (weekday per hour)](https://github.com/MarcoFernandez14/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)  
The gender breakdown doesn't change the general conclusion (previous slide) in terms of bikes being used mainly during rush hours.  

![Trips by gender by weekday)](https://github.com/MarcoFernandez14/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)  
The male subscribers are the main users of the bikes and specially during weekdays.  

## Summary
The analysis outcome suggests that the bikesharing service in New York City is very popular specially between men riders and during weekdays rush hours.  
Additionally, I would also explore:  
* Men vs Women usage. This way we could better understand the usage difference by in gender. I would display the bikesharing usage by gender by hour of the day and by station.  
* Outliers. I would display each bikeid's data in points charts or box and whisker charts. This way we can identify problems in the data and perhaps bikes or stations sensors malfunctioning.
